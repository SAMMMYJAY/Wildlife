                <h2>The Trouble with Bears</h2>
                <p>By Evan Wild</p>
                <p>Lumbering, angry, dangerous—the real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food.</p>
                <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article, we try to answer these questions and give you a real insight into the life of bears.</p>

                <h1>Types of Bears</h1>
                <p>Bears come in two varieties—large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen small bears, then it was probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>
